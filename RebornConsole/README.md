# RebornConsole Snippets

This folder is for documentation purposes only.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit actual C# snippet files to this repository.

When Claude generates RebornConsole snippets for testing/exploration:
1. Claude should print the snippet directly in the chat
2. User copies and pastes the snippet into RebornConsole
3. Snippets should NOT be saved as files in this folder

This keeps the repository clean and avoids committing temporary debugging code.
